<h2>Hey there!</h2>

I am Mathias Parger. I live in Graz, Austria - the city in which I also did my studies in computer science.
I created this page to share my research with you, and to add some context and personal stories to the projects.
My main fields of interest include machine learning, computer vision, and computer graphics - typically with a focus on efficiency and performance.
I love to make stuff go faster, and I think that performance is often the foundation for innovation - by removing constraints that hold back progress.
